### OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
Return your entire response **strictly as a valid JSON array** — nothing else.

Each question object must have the following fields:

[
  {
    "type": "mcq",                  // "mcq" or "theory"
    "question_text": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "options": ["Conversion of sunlight to energy", "Respiration", "Evaporation", "None"],
    "correct_answer": "Conversion of sunlight to energy",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "max_score": 1
  },
  {
    "type": "theory",
    "question_text": "Explain the process of photosynthesis.",
    "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy stored in glucose.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "max_score": 3
  }
]

### RULES
1. Include both MCQs and theory questions.
2. Provide **exactly one correct answer** for each MCQ.
3. Keep theory answers concise but meaningful.
4. Assign realistic difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.
5. Use `max_score = 1` for MCQs and `max_score = 3` for theory questions.
6. Avoid duplicate or trivial questions.
7. Do not include explanations or commentary outside the JSON array.
8. The final output must be **pure JSON** — no Markdown, no extra text.
